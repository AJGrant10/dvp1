### Before you Begin...
This repository includes a "*Challenges*" folder that contains your initial coding assignments. Attend or review the first Lecture / GoTo meeting **BEFORE** working on this material. Be sure to take notes and ask questions. After this, you can begin to work on these coding challenges.

For additional instruction, review the [coding instructions](https://github.com/ePortfolios/dvp1/tree/master/Challenges).
